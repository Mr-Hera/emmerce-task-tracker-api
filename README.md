# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Create a simple REST API that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete items from a
todo list. The API should be able to:

    Create a new todo item with a title and description.
        • Retrieve a list of all todo items.
        • Retrieve a specific todo item by ID.
        • Update a specific todo item by ID.
        • Delete a specific todo item by ID.

Use the Django framework, and use HTTP and JSON for communication.
After creating the API, create a simple client that can consume the API and perform the CRUD
operations on the todo list. The client can be a command-line application or a web application.
Again, you can use any language or framework you prefer, but you should use HTTP and JSON
for communication.

    Requirements

        • The API should be well-documented and easy to use.
        • The API should have an authentication.
        • The API should be secure and protect against common attacks, such as SQL injection
        and cross-site scripting.
        • The client should be well-designed and easy to use.
        • The client should handle errors and provide useful feedback to the user.
        • The code should be well-organized and easy to understand.
        • Submission

Please submit your code as a ZIP file or a link to a public repository. Your submission
should include:

    • Source code for the API.
    • Source code for the client.
    • Documentation for the API.
    • Instructions for running the code.
